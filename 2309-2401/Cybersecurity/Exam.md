# Cybers√©curity #

## 1. Cryptography ##

### Cybersecurity's objective ###
To defend computers, data, servers, and networks against malicious attacks.

### The four security properties ###
Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, and Non-repudiation.

### Symmetric Cryptography ### 
Focused on shared secret keys for encryption and decryption of messages.

### Asymmetric Cryptography ### 
Involves public and private keys for secure communication between parties.

### Hash Functions ###
Used to ensure the integrity of messages.

## 2. Cryptography ##

### public key infrastructure (PKI) ###

###  trust models ###

### TLS protocol ###

### card payment systems ###

## 3. Cybersecurity ##
