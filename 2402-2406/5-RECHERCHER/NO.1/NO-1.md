[Unspecified] Machine learning, Medical imaging | 5. The pathologists spend a lot of time and disgree with each other when making a diagnosis. Now commonly used Automated WSI image analysis is plagued by a myriad of challenges. Introducted Deep learning methods for histopathological image analysis. This study introduces a generalized deep learning framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalizability  of histopathology tissue analysis. 【The contributions】Ensemble segmentation model; Training pipeline; Inference pipeline; Lymph node metastases classification from WSI images; Uncertainty estimation(Mahendra Khened et al., 2021, p. 3)  | 6.

Segmentation of digital histopathology images presents three challenges:complex clinical features, inadequate training data, and the huge size of a single histopathological image. There are still problems with model training for existing solutions. This paper proposes a new architecture for the segmentation problem - feature pyramid. 【The Contribution】(1)solve the problem of the extremely large size of training data;(2) solve the contradiction between classification and location;(3)integration of contextual information. | 6.(1)resample (2)analyzed the contradiction & introduced new GICN structure using ResNet50 & Discussed the importance of spatial information to semantic segmentation (3) Proposed to use GPP structure to explore multi-scale semantic information.(Qin et al., 2018, p. 3) | 7. Proposed an image semantic segmentation algorithm based on feature Pyramid (ResNet50-GICN-GPP).The proposed method achieves 63% of the average segmentation accuracy | 8. (Qin et al., 2018, p. 8) | 9.

The deterministic deep learning models have achieved state‑of‑the‑art performance in various medical image analysis tasks, including nuclei segmentation from histopathology images. The deterministic models focus on improving the model prediction accuracy without assessing the confidence in the predictions. | 6. (1)propose a semantic segmentation model " BayesNuSeg model " using Bayesian representation to segment nuclei from the histopathology images and to further quantify the epistemic uncertainty; (2)employ Bayesian approximation with Monte‐Carlo (MC) dropout during the inference time to estimate the model’s prediction uncertainty. | 7. use F1‑score and intersection over union (IoU) as the evaluation metrics. The proposed approach achieves a mean F1‑score of 0.893 ± 0.008 and an IoU value of 0.868 ± 0.003 on the test set of the PanNuke dataset. These results outperform the Hover‑net, which has a mean F1‑score of 0.871 ± 0.010 and an IoU value of 0.840 ± 0.032. | 8. The proposed approach, which incorporates Bayesian representation and Monte‑Carlo dropout, demonstrates superior performance in segmenting nuclei from histopathology images.
