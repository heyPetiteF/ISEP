### Autonomous Vehicle
Autonomous vehicles are transforming modern transportation by offering advanced driving capabilities that rely on sophisticated sensors, data exchanges, and artificial intelligence. These vehicles aim to reduce human involvement, which currently accounts for 90% of traffic accidents, leading to significant safety improvements.

### Traffic Jam & Health
Autonomous vehicles can reduce the negative impacts of traffic jams on both mental and physical health. By optimizing traffic flow, autonomous driving systems can alleviate congestion, reduce stress for drivers, and lower the emissions that contribute to respiratory health issues.

### Global Function Approach
The development of autonomous vehicles requires a **global function approach**, integrating various systems like sensors, data analysis, and decision-making processes. This approach ensures that the vehicle operates efficiently under different driving conditions, enhancing overall performance and safety.

### Safety Issues: Best Practices
Safety is a primary concern in the development of autonomous vehicles. To address these concerns, **best practices** must be applied in areas such as software validation, sensor calibration, cybersecurity, and ethical decision-making algorithms, ensuring the highest safety standards are met.

### Human Involvement - 90%
Currently, human error is responsible for 90% of traffic accidents. Autonomous vehicles aim to drastically reduce this number by minimizing human involvement in driving decisions, relying instead on sensor data and AI-driven algorithms.

### 2040 Vision
By the year **2040**, it is expected that autonomous vehicles will become widespread, fundamentally altering the landscape of personal and public transportation. The advancements in sensor technologies, data exchanges, and artificial intelligence will drive this shift toward fully autonomous driving.

### Disruptive Electronic Architecture Due to Data Exchanges (Cloud Included)
The shift toward autonomous vehicles has introduced **disruptive electronic architectures** driven by the massive volume of data exchanges between the vehicle, sensors, cloud systems, and external infrastructure. This new architecture supports real-time decision-making, vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) communication, and large-scale data analytics.

### Comparison of Sensors: Radar, LiDAR, Camera

| **Sensor** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Radar**  | - Lower cost <br> - Works well in various weather conditions <br> - Requires moderate computation <br> - Good range | - Limited resolution and detail |
| **LiDAR**  | - More sensitive to weather than radar <br> - Provides high-resolution data <br> - Longer range for object detection | - High cost <br> - Weather sensitivity is better than radar, but worse than cameras |
| **Camera** | - Low cost <br> - Long range for object detection | - High computation needs <br> - Highly sensitive to weather conditions (e.g., rain, fog, and low light) |

### Areas for Improvement: Sensor Fusion
To further enhance the performance and reliability of autonomous vehicles, **sensor fusion** technology must be improved. This involves combining data from multiple sensors (radar, LiDAR, and cameras) to create a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle's surroundings. Effective sensor fusion allows for better decision-making, compensating for the weaknesses of individual sensors.

## V2V(vehicle to vehicle)车与车通信
V2V technology allows vehicles to communicate directly with each other, sharing critical driving information. This exchange of information helps prevent accidents, improves road safety, and optimizes traffic flow. V2V typically uses short-range wireless communication (DSRC) or 5G networks. Key applications include:

- **Collision Avoidance**: Vehicles share data like speed, position, and direction in real time. If the system detects a potential collision, it alerts the driver or autonomously takes action to avoid it.
- **Emergency Braking Alerts**: When a vehicle in front suddenly brakes, it can send an alert to vehicles behind it, allowing them to slow down or change direction in time, preventing chain-reaction crashes.
- **Blind Spot Warning**: If another vehicle is in the driver’s blind spot, the system can alert the driver, enhancing safety.
- **Platooning车辆编队行驶**: V2V can enable coordinated driving among multiple vehicles, allowing them to share acceleration, deceleration, and steering information. This can form tight vehicle groups, improving highway traffic efficiency.

## V2I(vehicle to Infrastructure)车与基础设施通信
V2I facilitates communication between vehicles and road infrastructure (e.g., traffic lights, road sensors, toll stations). This helps optimize traffic management, reduce congestion, and enhance driving comfort. Common applications include:

- **Traffic Light Information Sharing**: Vehicles can communicate with traffic signals to receive real-time data on the status of the lights (e.g., how long the light will remain green). This allows vehicles to adjust speed to avoid sudden stops or abrupt braking.
- **Real-Time Traffic Information**: Sensors on the road detect traffic flow, speed, and conditions, sharing this data with vehicles. Drivers can use this information to choose optimal routes, avoiding congestion and reducing travel time.
- **Road Maintenance and Obstacle Alerts**: V2I systems can notify vehicles about road repairs or unexpected obstacles, helping drivers adjust their routes.
- **Smart Parking Guidance**: With V2I, vehicles can communicate with parking infrastructure, quickly locating available spaces and improving parking efficiency.
